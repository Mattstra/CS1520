        <p> The Chupacabra is a creature from South American folklore that is also known as<br>
          <p> the goat sucker. The first supposed sightings of this creature were in Puerto<br>
            <p> Rico during the mid 90s. The Chupacabra is most commonly described as being a<br>
              <p> reptile like creature with spines running down its back. However there is also<br>
                <p> another description of it looking more like a breed of dog with pronounced spines<br>
                  <p> running down its back.
